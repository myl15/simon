                The Simon Game is a highly challenging electronic memory game. 
                It involves the sequential activation of buttons, 
                each of which is characterized by a unique color and auditory stimulus, 
                in a prescribed order that is indicated by an array of illuminating diodes 
                and acoustical signals.
